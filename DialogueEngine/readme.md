### Explanation

This project is for an upcoming video game I am creating with the Unreal Engine 5 C++ framework. It is my most recent project, and a much better example of cleaner code. There are comments put throughout to describe what is happening, less redundancy, and overall more professional formatting. However, there are still some vague method and variable names, as well as redundancy with the two switch statements. </br>

<br/> I learned several important concepts from this project. Arguably the most important is the hierarchy that can be achieved through object inheritance. Additionally, I also began to touch on polymorphism through the constructor and deconstructor virtual functions. Finally, I also implemented enumerators for the first time, which is something I neglected to use in the past. I think it makes the switch statements make much more sense.
