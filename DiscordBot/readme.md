### Explanation

This is my most ambitious project that I have created, and took around a month to get working consistently. The project relies on a large database of HTML files that are not present in this repo. Each HTML file of this database corresponded to a past question from a past exam of the International Baccalaureate program. 
The function of this project was to allow a user to compile test questions together through the interface of discord bot slash commands. Under the hood, this involved complicated substring algorithms that would compile test questions together into one html file, and make it available to the user through a browser. </br>

</br> Although the program eventually worked 100% of the time, the implementation is very messy and is not easy for someone to follow. This was my first project that involved creating my own classes, and I did not have the current knowledge of class hierarchy that this project would have beneffited from. I did take advantage of nested classes, 
although this arguably makes the program harder to follow. Below is an example of a user searching for a biology term, and creating a test relevant to their inputted term. </br> ![ibbot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c619253a-9abc-4c58-9be5-963b05c1fff1) </br>

</br> Despite the mess, I learned a lot from this project. I learned how to create classes, methods, object members, public/private scope, and methods for string slicing.
